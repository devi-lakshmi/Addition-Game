# Addition Game

 The **Addition Game** is a simple interactive web app where users solve basic addition problems. Users are presented with two random numbers, and they must input the correct sum. The app allows users to check their answers and restart the game with new random numbers.


## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: For generating random numbers, handling user input, and checking answers.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and layout components.

## How It Works

1. Two random numbers are displayed on the screen.
2. The user inputs the sum of the two numbers in the input field.
3. When the user clicks the "Check" button, the app compares the user's input to the correct sum.
4. A message is displayed indicating whether the answer is correct or not.
5. The "Restart" button generates new random numbers for the user to solve.
